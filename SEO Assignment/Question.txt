</body>
</html>


Q3. What are the Benefits of Using Meta Tags?
->Meta tags are important because they impact how your site appears in the SERPs and how many people will be inclined to click through to your website. 
They will therefore impact your traffic and engagement rates, which can impact your SEO and rankings.

Q5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.
-> The small graphical representation of the website you are visiting, which is visible on the left to the website’s name in the address bar, is called a favicon. It is a shortened expression for ‘favorite icon.’ 
It helps you identify the visited website among the many open tabs. For example, The fancy P that appears on the tab left of the ProCreator website’s address bar is the favicon for us.
